## Research Interests

My research interests reside within the burgeoning field of Edge Computing, particularly in data and control plane optimization strategies aimed at bolstering the performance of Edge Computing applications in geographically distributed environments. My current research endeavors delve into leveraging the edge for augmenting the capabilities of autonomous driving systems in the domains of collaborative maneuvering and collaborative perception. A significant portion of my research focuses on the development of accurate simulations and emulations for collaborative autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This work seeks to provide a robust platform for evaluating and optimizing CAV decision-making and performance in diverse scenarios, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safe and efficient autonomous driving technologies.

### Edge Computing

There are many applications now that would be feasible only if we were able to a make a system for the edge that could handle the low latency requirements of these use cases, while also being able to maintain good throughput and performance. My research in this area strives to elevate the Edge to be a peer of the Cloud. I work in this research area advised by [Dr. Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/).

### Autonomous Vehicles

I am specifically focused on research that uses the edge to alleviate problems in autonomous vehicles, namely in collaborative perception and maneuvering. I work on this research area with [Dr. Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/) and [Dr. Alexandros Daglis](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~adaglis3/).
