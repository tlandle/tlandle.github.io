## Research Interests

My research interests lie in in Edge Computing, specifically in data and control plane optimization to enhance the performance of Edge Computing applications in a geo-distributed setting.

### Edge Computing

There are many applications now that would be feasible only if we were able to a make a system for the edge that could handle the low latency requirements of these use cases, while also being able to maintain good throughput and performance. My research in this area strives to elevate the Edge to be a peer of the Cloud. I work in this research area advised by [Dr. Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/).

### Autonomous Vehicles

I am specifically focused on research that uses the edge to alleviate problems in autonomous vehicles, namely in collaborative perception and maneuvering. I work on this research area with [Dr. Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/) and [Dr. Alexandros Daglis](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~adaglis3/).
