Work Experience
---------------

#### Senior Software Engineer | Lockheed Martin | June 2020 - Present

Advanced Development Programs

- Lead C/C++ vehicle control software development on embedded linux and baremetal platforms
- Designed distributed/edge systems software in C/C++ for systems using combinations of wired and wireless protocols and communication standards
- Developed YoctoLinux and baremetal software for Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC, ARM64 architecture system
- YoctoLinux toolchain/SDK development for both Windows and Linux development systems.

#### Lead Embedded Software Engineer | Georgia Tech Research Institute | August 2019 - June 2020

- Lead middleware developer for radar research products, developing abstraction layer between application and FPGA via Ethernet/AXI based communication using C++
- Lead developer on Ettus Software Defined Radio development using C++/Python APIs and GNU Radio
- Developed baremetal software to control filters/DAC for incoming/outgoing signals in C using MPLAB
- Developer for ALQ-213 using PowerPC MPC5200 Processor, and VxWorks 653 Partitioned/Module OS to communicate between interior “Guest” OSes.
- Lead effort to improve portability with in C/C++ code by reorganizing bitfield based structures into bit mask and shift based implementations
- Lead development of Partitioned OS compatible with POSIX and an emulated socket based ethernet stack in order to connect legacy VxWorks system with “system of systems” STITCHES generated code in C/C++.
- Developed ethernet communication for avionics radio communication logic in C, conducted code reviews on other developer code in Bitbucket
- Designed test harness and infrastructure in Python in order to test new partition functionality as well as test/characterize system for STITCHES integration needs.
- Built Vagrant compatible virtual windows development/build environment to build RTOS software seamlessly which removed massive overhead in keeping legacy Vxworks tools updated with continuously updating versions of windows.

#### Embedded Software Engineer | General Electric | July 2017 - August 2019

- Lead developer and functional owner for YoctoLinux based OS on ARM Cortex A53(Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC) and x86_64 Intel based platforms.
- Technical and Project Lead for TSN integration on locomotive control nodes, responsible for integration of scheduling infrastructure and overall hardware/software integration tasks.
- Lead developer for implementation of I/O messaging system driver in the ARM Linux kernel, leveraging use of softirqs to ensure efficient and performant delivery of I/O information from several I/O cards, using a proprietary messaging and networking protocol.
- Lead developer on software drivers that exercise many different areas of the Linux Kernel, including SPI, USB, I2C, and custom AXI FPGA device drivers.
-Team Lead of Agile team as Scrum Master, using CA Agile Central(Rally) to denote priorities and tasks, plan sprints, assign team members to relevant tasks, and track velocity.

#### Edison Engineering Development Program | General Electric | July 2015 - July 2017

Edison Engineering Development Program(EEDP) is a two- to three-year early career program consisting of three or more rotational assignments. Rotational assignments are engineering projects driven by real GE business priorities. The program cultivates technical problem-solving skills via advanced engineering coursework, formal reports and presentations to senior leadership, in addition to valuable work experience. 

##### Embedded Software Engineer | July 2016 - July 2017

- Worked with a cross functional team on development and integration of drivers that interface with FPGA and peripherals for new Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC in YoctoLinux OS.
-Drivers developed/integrated include:
- Keypad Interface, Touchscreen Integration, PCI Express Gen2, Chromium Integration,UCD9016
Power Sequencer, TPM, PMU(Power Management Unit).
-Migrated YoctoLinux from Linux Kernel 4.4 to 4.9.
-Used Perl , Python, and Bash to develop Power On Self Test mechanism for locomotive display as well as other necessary boot, flash/eMMC/EEPROM programming, and initialization functions.
-Implemented Secure(Encrypted and Authenticated) Boot and Multi-boot(golden image boot) to enhance security and reliability.
-Developed documentation/automated how to build and create necessary boot files for SD Boot, USB Boot, and flash/eMMC.

##### Electronic Hardware Design Engineer | February 2016 - July 2016

- Lead obsolescence schematic design and verification for ethernets on display and consolidated input/output panels.
- Developed production test software for display card and consolidated input/output panel using QNX 6.3.2 and 6.5 RTOS.
- Developed FPGA based keypad interface and verification test software for development of new display using Xilinx Vivado on Zynq Ultrascale+ and PetaLinux OS.
- Established battery contactor control logic and developed verification test software on CPLD using Xilinx ISE 14.7 and QNX 6.4 OS.

##### Systems Engineer | July 2015 - February 2016

- Developed concept level solution to turbocharger reliability issues
- Developed system level requirements to be passed down to component level engineers
- Verified consolidated cooling models using hardware in the loop testing
- Analyzed subsystem level requirements for new real time clock algorithm
- Compared different software in the loop alternatives for next generation simulation testing
